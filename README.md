📊 Financial Performance Dashboard (Power BI)
This project is a Power BI Dashboard analyzing the financial performance of a retail dataset.
It uncovers sales, profit, discount patterns, and performance across products, segments, and geographies.

🚀 Executive Snapshot
Scale: 1.13M units → $118.73M sales → $12.06M profit (≈ 10.2% margin; ≈ $105 revenue & $10.7 profit per unit).
Momentum: 2014 vs 2013 — Sales +249% (26.4M → 92.3M), Profit +644% (1.43M → 10.64M). Margin nearly doubled (5.4% → 11.5%).
Where money is made: Germany (3.3M) and Mexico (3.0M) are top profit countries, not top revenue ones. Margin pressure in USA/Canada.
What’s hurting: Two products—Amarilla (-23M) and VTT (-22M)—wipe out a huge chunk of profit despite strong sales.
📈 Growth & Seasonality
Best quarter: Q4-2014 with $29.8M sales and $6.0M profit (clear peak).
Weakest quarter: Q3-2013 with a ~$0.4M loss.
Watch Q2-2014: Strong sales ($22.7M) but negligible profit (~$0.2M) → heavy discounting or cost spike likely.
🌍 Geography
Top revenue countries: USA (25.0M), Canada (24.9M), France (24.4M), Germany (23.5M), Mexico (21.0M).
Profit leaders: Germany & Mexico.
Insight: NA mix/discounts are unfavorable vs EU/LatAm.
🏢 Segment Profitability
Small Business: +26M profit → the growth engine.
Government (+8M) and Enterprise (+4M): healthy.
Midmarket (-12M) and Channel Partners (-15M): deeply loss-making.
👉 If these two segments break even, profit jumps from ~12M → ~39M.
📦 Product Performance & Discounting
Top seller: Paseo $33M (≈28% of revenue).
Bottom by profit: Amarilla (-23M), VTT (-22M), Velo (-1M).
Discount signal: Heaviest-discounted products (Amarilla, VTT, Velo) = least profitable.
Segment-product mismatch: Some products thrive in Government/Small Business but destroy value in Midmarket/Channel Partners.
🔍 Unit Economics & Mix
2014 = 76% of total units (861K/1.13M) → growth is volume-led and margin-accretive.
“Low units” ≠ “bad”: e.g., Carretera (~147K units) is margin-healthy (lowest discounts, not in loss list).
⚠️ Likely Root Causes
Over-discounting specific SKUs (Amarilla, VTT, Velo), especially in Midmarket & Channel Partners.
Country mix issues (USA/Canada high volume but thin margins).
Selling the wrong SKUs in loss-making segments.
